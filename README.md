#  Hey there, I'm Sunil — I help teams automate and scale their applications using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and DevOps tools 

I’m a DevOps & Cloud Engineer passionate about automation, infrastructure as code, and cloud-native solutions.
With hands-on experience in Docker, Terraform, Linux, and CI/CD, I design and deploy scalable infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
My goal is to make deployment fast, repeatable, and secure — from code to production.
